# Advanced API - Expand our Project (Wk4 Day4)

In class on Thursday we built out some API wrapper functions, and a program to add and remove books from a user's reading list.

For homework you will need to amass 15 points by making improvements in the following areas:
Code Structure, Code Efficiency, Functionality
## Structure

* Created 3 Classes/Modules
* Importing 2 Class/Modules
* A class of UI handles user functions and calls upon the imported class of ApiFuncs that handles all the API Functions, created and imported a class BookFuncs that handles functions relating to books called on my "main" logic

## Efficiency

* By creating these Classes/Modules the application is easier to augment or change over time

* Moved many of the redundant functions such as filter/lambda to BookFuncs for more efficient processing 
## Functionality
* Added functions for user to edit first name, last name, and password
* Added delete function for user to delete account
* Added messaging to include users first name
